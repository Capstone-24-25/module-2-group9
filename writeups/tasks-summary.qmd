### HTML scraping

Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.
Including header content does not seem to improve predictions. Our metrics of interest were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and ROC AUC. When using only paragraphs content, we obtain an accuracy of 0.835. However, when using both paragraphs and headers content, we obtain an accuracy of 0.759.

### Bigrams

Do bigrams capture additional information relevant to the classification of interest? Answer the question, **briefly** describe what analysis you conducted to arrive at your answer, and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

### Neural net

Summarize the neural network model you trained by describing:

-   architecture

-   optimization and loss
