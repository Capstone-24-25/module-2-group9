### HTML scraping

**Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.**
Including header content does not seem to improve predictions. Our metrics of interest were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and ROC AUC, as our model is a binary classification model distinguishing between the presence or lack of presence of relevant content. The data that only included paragraph content has an accuracy of 0.835. Alternatively, the data that captured both paragraph and header content had an accuracy score of 0.779. This outcome may be expected, as including the header content introduces noise to our model. When we initially parsed the HTML content, the function transforms our text by removing unwanted elements like URLS, emails, punctuation, digits, and whitespace. In this project, the headers serve as a brief identification of the larger paragraph content listed, so it's reasonable to assume that the lack of meaningful content might weaken the predictive accuracy of a model that it is used to working with. Additionally, we used techniques of principal component analysis, retaining 70% of the variance, and logistic principal component regression to reduce dimensionality. These techniques are sensitive to noise, which could explain the reduction in model accuracy once the header content was included.
The paragraph and header content received a score of 0.728 for sensitivity, 0.798 for specificity, and 0.816 for ROC AUC. The paragraph content without headers received a score of .88 for sensitivity, 0.790 for specificity, and 0.878 for ROC AUC. Based on these results, our paragraph only data is better at identifying true positives, with a stronger ability to discern between our two classes as identified by the improved ROC AUC score. Interestingly, the paragraph and header content was slightly better at identifying true negatives. However, the paragraph only content has overall better predictive accuracy, so the marginal discrepancy in specificity score can be overlooked for the generally more favorable other metrics. The inclusion of headers ultimately reducing the predictive accuracy of our model potentially indicates that the content captured by the headers resulted in some sort of model overfitting, making it more difficult to identify relevant text and accurately classify the information.
