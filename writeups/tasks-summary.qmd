Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.
Including header content does not seem to improve predictions. Our metrics of interest were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and ROC AUC, as our model is a binary classification model distinguishing between the presence or lack of presence of relevant content. The data that only included paragraph content has an accuracy of 0.835. Alternatively, the data that captured both paragraph and header content had an accuracy score of 0.779. This outcome may be expected, as including the header content introduces noise to our model. In this project, the headers serve as a brief identification of the larger paragraph content listed, so it's reasonable to assume that the lack of meaningful content might weaken the predictive accuracy of a model that is used to working with. Additionally, we used techniques of principal component analysis and logistic principal component regression to reduce dimensionality. These techniques which are sensitive to noise, which could explain the reduction in model accuracy once the header content was included.

The inclusion of headers ultimately reducing the predictive accuracy of our model potentially indicates that 


### Bigrams
